# ICP Token Wallet

## Overview

The **ICP Token Wallet** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to securely manage tokens on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain.The ICP Token Wallet is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide secure and efficient management of tokens on the ICP blockchain. This wallet is built using React for the frontend and Rust for the backend, combining modern, user-friendly design principles with robust and secure blockchain technology. The application allows users to send, receive, and monitor token balances seamlessly

## Key Features of the ICP Token Wallet:

**Decentralized Architecture:**
The wallet operates as a dApp on the ICP blockchain, ensuring data integrity and eliminating reliance on centralized servers.

**Secure Backend with Rust:**
Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and memory safety, powers the backend of the wallet.
Smart contracts (canisters) written in Rust handle token transactions and manage the wallet's core functionality.

**User-Friendly Frontend with React:**
The React-based frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the wallet.
Key functionalities, such as sending and receiving tokens, are easily accessible via a clean and responsive design.

**Token Management:**
Users can send tokens to other addresses, receive tokens, and view their current token balances in real-time.
Supports the IRCRC2 token standard, ensuring compatibility with other dApps and wallets on the ICP blockchain.

**Blockchain Security and Transparency:**
All transactions are secured through the ICP blockchain's cryptographic mechanisms.
The wallet implements best practices to prevent unauthorized access and potential exploits.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Rust
- **Blockchain**: Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- Rust toolchain (with Cargo)
- dfx cli

## Step-by-Step Procedure to Develop the Project:

**Step 1: Environment Setup**

*Install Rust:*
Download and install Rust from rust-lang.org.
Use the command rustup update to ensure the latest version.

*Install DFX SDK:*
Download the DFINITY Canister SDK (DFX) from internetcomputer.org.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Verify installation using dfx --version.

*Set up Node.js and React:*
Install Node.js from nodejs.org to set up the frontend environment.
Use npx create-react-app icp-wallet-frontend to initialize a React project.

*Set up a Local Test Network:*
Run dfx start to initialize a local ICP test environment.

*Set up a Project Directory:*
Create a new directory for the project using mkdir icp_token_wallet.
Navigate to the directory using cd icp_token_wallet.
Run dfx new wallet_project to generate a new ICP project.

## Step 2: Develop the Backend (Smart Contracts)

*Define IRCRC2 Token Interface:*
Research and implement the IRCRC2 token standard.
Add modules to support token sending, receiving, and balance retrieval.

*Write Rust Code for Token Management:*
Navigate to the src directory of your project.

*Open main.rs and implement:*
Functions for sending tokens (transfer function).
Functions for receiving tokens (onReceive handler).
A balance display function that queries and formats the token balance.

*Implement Security Features:*
Use cryptographic signing to verify transactions.
Implement checks to prevent overflows and unauthorized access.

*Compile the Smart Contracts:*
Run dfx build to compile the Rust code into WebAssembly (Wasm) modules.

## Step 3: Develop the Frontend (React Application)

*Setup React Project:*
Use npx create-react-app to scaffold the frontend interface.
Organize the project structure into components for easier development.

*Create Wallet Interface:*
Design user-friendly forms and dashboards using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
Implement forms for sending tokens, receiving tokens, and viewing balances.

*Connect Frontend to Backend:*
Use the DFX JavaScript agent library to interact with ICP canisters.
Configure canister IDs and backend API endpoints in the dfx.json file.

*Display Token Balance:*
Use React hooks (e.g., useEffect and useState) to fetch and display the wallet's token balance.

*Handle Transactions:*
Implement functions to call the transfer and onReceive methods of the backend canisters.
Validate and show success/error messages to the user.

## Step 4: Deploy the Smart Contracts

*Start the Local Test Network:*
Use dfx start to ensure the local network is running.

*Deploy the Contracts:*
Run dfx deploy to upload the compiled Wasm modules to the local ICP test network.

*Initialize the Wallet:*
Use dfx canister call commands to initialize token balances and addresses.

## Step 5: Testing

*Write Unit Tests:*
Use the ICP testing framework to write unit tests for backend functionalities.
Validate token transfers, balance updates, and security features.

*Run Frontend Integration Tests:*
Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure frontend functionality.

*Simulate Edge Cases:*
Test for potential issues like double-spending, invalid addresses, or overflow errors.
